    <li>Drawing is one of my hobbies. Drawing just makes me forget everything and focus on drawing a thing.</li>
    <li>Painting is another one of my hobbies. Painting has the same effect on me as drawing where I focus on it way too much.</li>
    <li>Gaming is the last one of my hobbies. Gaming is what mostly everyone does in their spare time but for me, gaming is just a way for me to escape the real world and play random games with my friends.</li>
